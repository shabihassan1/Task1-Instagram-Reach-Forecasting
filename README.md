## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and forecast Instagram reach using historical data. By understanding the patterns and trends in the data, we can develop a predictive model to forecast future reach, helping content creators optimize their posting strategy.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand trends, patterns, and distributions.
3. Statistical Analysis: Calculating key statistics for different days of the week.
4. Time Series Decomposition: Identifying and analyzing seasonal and trend components.
5. Forecasting: Using the SARIMA model to predict future Instagram reach and evaluating model performance.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Import Libraries and Load Data

Load necessary libraries and the dataset for analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'path_to_your_file/Instagram-Reach (1).csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display first few rows of the dataset
data.head()
